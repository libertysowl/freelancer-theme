I lived both in Latin America and Spain, acquiring a deep understanding of cultural differences and idioms. This allows me to successfully adapt the vocabulary to a specific audience or market and to create useful, readable, and engaging texts that will sound natural in the target language.<br>
Over the last 12 years, I have been working with clients from all corners of the world and a wide variety of industries and sectors. I always deliver high quality texts with a fast turnaround, making sure that the information is coherent, accurate and perfectly written.</p>
